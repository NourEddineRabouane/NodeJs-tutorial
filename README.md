## This repository inludes simple codes about NodeJs during my learning journey

<!-- File-System -->

#### The 'File-System' folder contains codes about the file System module

###### The app.js containes a programe that watch the command.txt file and execute the writable commands if it exists

###### This programme is implimented using the simple Asyncrounus way 'Promises'

<!-- Streams -->

### The 'Streams' folder contains codes wich deal with streams

##### The writable folder is dedicated for writable streams

###### The writable.js file containes a code that write to a text file one million time

###### It is implimented using the basic Asyncrounus way and also using streams to find out the diffrences between them

##### The readable folder is dedicated for readable streams

###### The readable.js file contains a code that read from the 'text.txt' file and write to 'dest.txt'

###### The write-even.js file read from the 'text.txt' file and write only the even numbers to 'dest.txt'
